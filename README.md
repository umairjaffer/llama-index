# LlamaIndex Ecosystem Exploration

Welcome to the **LlamaIndex Ecosystem Exploration** repository! This repo is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing **LlamaIndex** (formerly GPT Index). LlamaIndex is a framework that enables easy integration between large language models (LLMs) and custom data sources for efficient retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into several sections, each focusing on key components of LlamaIndex:

### 1. Introduction to LlamaIndex
- **Goal**: Understand the basics of LlamaIndex and its core functionalities.
- **Content**:
  - Overview of LlamaIndex's architecture and use cases.
  - Installing LlamaIndex.
  - Basic examples on how to create and query an index.

### 2. Core Concepts
- **Indices**: Learn how to create and customize different types of indices for various use cases (Tree, List, and more).
- **Query Engines**: Explore various query mechanisms provided by LlamaIndex for efficient data retrieval.
- **LLMs Integration**: Understand how LlamaIndex connects LLMs like GPT and LLaMA to your data for enhanced information retrieval.

### 3. Data Integration
- **External Data Sources**: Integrate LlamaIndex with multiple data sources including:
  - **Local Files** (text, PDFs, etc.)
  - **Databases**
  - **Web Scraping**
- **Custom Data Connectors**: Build custom connectors to pull in specific data types.

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for optimizing query prompts.
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Explore how to use LlamaIndex to provide context-aware responses by combining LLMs with your datasets.
- **Optimization and Scaling**: Improve performance when handling large datasets or complex queries.

### 5. Example Projects
A collection of use cases that demonstrate LlamaIndexâ€™s versatility:
- **Document Summarization**: Automatically summarize long documents using LLMs and LlamaIndex.
- **Question Answering System**: Build an intelligent QA system by combining LlamaIndex and GPT-based models.
- **Knowledge Graph Building**: Use LlamaIndex to construct and query knowledge graphs from unstructured data.
